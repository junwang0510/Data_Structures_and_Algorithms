    Why is the worst-case runtime of comparison sorting O(n*log(n))?

<ul>
    <li>Model a decision tree as shown in the picture</li>
    <li>Total # of decisions for n elements = n!</li>
    <li>In the worst case, # of decisions = log(n!)</li>
    <li>Therefore, the worst case runtime of comparison sorting = O(log(n!)) = O(n*log(n))</li>
</ul>
