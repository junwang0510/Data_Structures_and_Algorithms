Why is the worst-case runtime of comparison sorting O(n*log(n))?
- Model a decision tree as shown in the picture
- Total # of decisions for n elements = n!
- In the worst case, # of decisions = log(n!)
- Therefore, the worst case runtime of comparison sorting = O(log(n!)) = O(n*log(n))


Insertion sort vs. Selection sort
- Selection sort requires less swapping
- Insertion sort is faster for almost sorted data
- On average, we prefer insertion sort for small arrays;
  However, if overwriting data is expensive, we would prefer selection sort
